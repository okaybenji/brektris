### Features
* Scoring
* Fail state
* Shooter power-up

## Juice
* Create a general effect for when objects are destroyed. Should create a new image in place of the destroyed object with the same texture. To start with, have it sink, rotate a bit randomly, fade out, and then destroy itself.
* Add sound effects
* Give balls a trail effect
* Explore art styles

### Bug Fixes
* Hard bricks shouldn't budge when they change to regular bricks
* Hitting a shell brick while it's tweening can cause it to move
