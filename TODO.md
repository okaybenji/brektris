# TODO

### Features
* Shop where players can spend points to unlock/upgrade power-ups (increase duration, cause them to appear more often, maybe shooter can upgrade to destroy shell bricks)
* Track stats, all-time and per game -- rows survived, bricks broken, gems collected

## Juice
* Create a general effect for when objects are destroyed
* Add sound effects
* Give balls a trail effect
* Explore art styles

### Bug Fixes
* Should not be possible to get a full row of shell bricks
* Sometimes the ball just starts flying through bricks?
* Seems like if you have two balls and they cross the paddle line in the same frame they are both destroyed

## General
* UI
* Menus
* Credits
