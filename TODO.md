# TODO

### Features
* Scoring
* Fail state

### Polish
* On touch devices, don't snap paddle to finger. Instead, move paddle by distance finger moved since touch started.

## Juice
* Create a general effect for when objects are destroyed. Should create a new image in place of the destroyed object with the same texture. To start with, have it sink, rotate a bit randomly, fade out, and then destroy itself.
* Add sound effects
* Give balls a trail effect
* Explore art styles

### Bug Fixes
* Hard bricks shouldn't budge when they change to regular bricks
* Should not be possible to get a full row of shell bricks

## General
* Menus
* Credits
* Shop where players can spend points to unlock/upgrade power-ups (increase duration, cause them to appear more often, maybe shooter can upgrade to destroy shell bricks)
